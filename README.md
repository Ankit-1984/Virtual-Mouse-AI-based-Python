# Virtual-Mouse-AI-based-Python
In this project, we have created an AI-based Mouse Controller. It will first detect the hand landmarks, then track and then perform functions. We have also applied smoothing techniques to make it more usable. The virtual mouse will be operated without touching any device or screen. The programming language used is mainly Python.
